> Drive Jira issue-tracking workflows from your terminal — built for coding agents.

`jira-cli` lets coding agents (Claude Code and others) — and humans — read,
search and **maintain** Jira issues from the command line: fetch issues,
run JQL searches, create/edit/assign issues, move them through workflow
transitions, and manage comments. It speaks to both **Jira Cloud** (REST v3)
and **Data Center / Server** (REST v2), returns agent-friendly JSON with
structured errors, and ships a companion Skill that teaches an agent how to
use it. Write commands support `--dry-run`, and destructive ones require `--yes`.

📖 **Documentation site:** <https://angelmsger.github.io/jira-cli/>

## Features

- **Cloud & Data Center** — one flavor-agnostic client; the backend is detected
  automatically, and the ADF-vs-plain-text body asymmetry is bridged so both
  flavors take and return plain text.
- **Agent-friendly** — JSON output by default, structured errors with exit
  codes and recovery hints, `{items, next, has_more}` pagination, and
  `--fields` projection so an agent spends minimal context.
- **Read & write** — fetch issues, JQL search (raw or composed from flags);
  create, edit and assign issues; workflow transitions with name resolution;
  read, post, edit and delete comments. Every write supports `--dry-run`;
  destructive commands need `--yes`.
- **Flexible configuration** — CLI flags, environment variables, a `.env` file,
  a YAML config file, or an interactive wizard; secrets stored in the OS
  keychain.
- **Companion Skill** — a `jira` Skill, embedded in the binary, that
  guides coding agents through the CLI.

## Installation

Install the CLI with npm, then take two short steps to finish setup — deploy
the companion Skill, then (optionally) enable shell completion.

### 1. Install the CLI — npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @angelmsger/jira-cli
```

npm downloads the prebuilt binary for your platform, verifies its SHA-256
checksum, and keeps upgrades one `npm update -g @angelmsger/jira-cli`
away.

<details>
<summary><strong>Other install methods</strong> — go install, source build, prebuilt binary</summary>

```bash
go install github.com/angelmsger/jira-cli/cmd/jira-cli@latest   # go 1.24+
make install                                                                # from a source checkout
```

Or download a prebuilt binary from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/angelmsger/jira-cli/releases). The full
[installation guide](docs/installation.md) covers every method.

</details>

### 2. Deploy the companion Skill

The `jira` Skill is embedded in the binary; it teaches your coding agent
(**Claude Code**, **Codex**) how to drive the CLI. `skill install` probes for
installed agents and installs into each one found:

```bash
jira-cli skill install            # auto-detect; install for each agent found
jira-cli skill install --agent codex
jira-cli skill uninstall          # remove it again
```

Re-run it after upgrading the CLI to keep the Skill version-matched. Details,
including the `npx skills` workflow, are in
[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md#3-install-the-companion-skill).

### 3. Enable shell completion (optional)

`jira-cli` completes subcommands, enum flag values and live project keys.
Load the completion script for your shell once:

```bash
source <(jira-cli completion bash)                       # bash, current shell
jira-cli completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_jira-cli"   # zsh, persistent
```

fish, PowerShell and persistent setup are covered in
[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md#2-enable-shell-completion).

## Quick start

```bash
jira-cli config init --pretty   # interactive TUI setup (recommended for humans)
jira-cli doctor                 # verify configuration and connectivity

jira-cli issue search --project ENG --assignee me
jira-cli issue get PROJ-123
jira-cli issue transition PROJ-123 --to "In Progress"
jira-cli comment add PROJ-123 --body "Deployed to staging."
```

## Configuration

Settings resolve in precedence order (highest first): CLI flags → environment
variables (`JIRA_*`) → `.env` → `~/.angelmsger/jira/config.yaml` → defaults.
See `.env.example` and
[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md). Secrets are stored in the OS
keychain. If Windows Credential Manager is unavailable, the fallback is
encrypted with per-user DPAPI; macOS/Linux retain the `0600` fallback. Secrets
are never written to the config file.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `issue get` | fetch one issue (key or URL) with normalized fields |
| `issue search` | JQL search, raw or built from `--project`/`--assignee`/`--status`/... |
| `issue create` / `edit` | create an issue; update summary/description/priority/labels |
| `issue assign` | change or clear the assignee (`--to` / `--unassign`) |
| `issue transitions` / `issue transition` | discover and run workflow transitions |
| `project list` / `project get` | browse projects |
| `comment list` / `add` / `update` / `delete` | read, post, edit and remove comments; `delete` needs `--yes` |
| `whoami` | print the user the credentials authenticate as |
| `user resolve` / `user me` | resolve a user selector to the identifier assignee flags accept |
| `skill install` / `skill uninstall` | deploy or remove the embedded companion Skill (Claude Code, Codex) |
| `config get-contexts` / `use-context` / `delete-context` | manage multiple named servers |
| `config` / `auth` / `doctor` / `version` | setup and diagnostics |

In the default JSON output, list commands return a `{items, next, has_more}`
envelope; pass `--cursor` with a prior page's `next` to read the following page,
or `--all` to fetch every page. `--format ndjson` instead streams the items
themselves, one JSON object per line.

### Multiple servers (contexts)

A single config file can hold several Jira servers as named *contexts*.
Most users need only one and never see the concept — `config init --pretty`
configures a `default` context and the flow is unchanged. To work with more
than one server, re-run `config init --pretty` and pick **Add a new context**,
then:

```bash
jira-cli config get-contexts          # list contexts, current marked
jira-cli config use-context prod      # switch the current context
jira-cli --use-context prod issue get PROJ-123   # override for one command
```

`JIRA_CONTEXT` overrides the current context via the environment. Legacy
single-server config files are read unchanged.

## Use as a Go library

The HTTP client that powers the CLI is published as a standalone Go package, so a
GUI or other tool can drive Jira directly — same normalized models, Cloud /
Data Center flavor handling and structured errors, without shelling out to the
binary.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	api "github.com/angelmsger/jira-cli/pkg/apiclient"
	cerr "github.com/angelmsger/jira-cli/pkg/errors"
	"github.com/angelmsger/jira-cli/pkg/transport"
)

// Authentication is a transport.Decorator you supply — it sets the
// Authorization header on every request. PAT uses a Bearer token:
func bearer(token string) transport.Decorator {
	return func(r *http.Request) { r.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+token) }
}

ctx := context.Background()
client, flavor, err := api.Build(ctx, api.BuildParams{
	BaseURL:       "https://jira.example.com",
	Flavor:        "auto", // "cloud" | "datacenter" | "auto"
	AuthDecorator: bearer(os.Getenv("JIRA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN")),
})
if err != nil { /* see error handling below */ }

issue, err := client.GetIssue(ctx, api.GetIssueOpts{Key: "PROJ-123"})
```

Errors are `*errors.CLIError` with a stable `Category` and `Code`, so callers branch
on failure kinds instead of parsing strings:

```go
if ce := cerr.AsCLIError(err); ce != nil {
    // ce.Category, ce.Code, ce.Hint, ce.NextSteps, ce.HTTPStatus, ce.Retryable
}
```

> These `pkg/...` packages primarily back this CLI and its companion Skill; their
> exported surface is treated as a stable contract. Read the package doc comment
> (`go doc ./pkg/apiclient`) before changing it.

## Development

```bash
make test       # unit + integration tests
make e2e        # build + run against an in-repo mock Jira server
make e2e-live   # additionally run read-only checks against the real server
make lint       # gofmt + go vet
make docs       # regenerate the CLI reference under docs/cli/
```

The [`docs/cli/`](docs/cli/README.md) reference is generated from the cobra
command tree by `cmd/gen-docs`, so it always matches `--help`. After changing a
command or flag, run `make docs` and commit the result — CI fails if it drifts.

See [docs/technical-design.md](docs/technical-design.md) for the architecture
and `internal/` package layout, [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) for the
release process, and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the version history.
